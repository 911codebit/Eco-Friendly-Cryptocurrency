# Eco-friendly cryptocurrency

Nowaways many cryptocurrencies uses a lot of energy which comes from polluting sources. On this context, I had the idea of developing a new one which mitigates those effects.

This cryptocurrency could be based on the existing ones, but having some distinctive features:

- Reward system: we can replace the classic 'proof of work' that consumes plenty of energy, with a 'proof of memory', which uses disk memory from miners' computers. Some cryptocurrencies have accomplish this so far.  
- (Innovative feature) Usage of memory: in order to give that memory space some purpose, we can use it as a distributed redundant cloud storage service, so that the energy will not only be used to keep the cryptocurrency running, but also to apply it on a service.

That way, this new cryptocurrency is going to dramatically reduce the energy consupmtion and achieve high efficiency rates.
